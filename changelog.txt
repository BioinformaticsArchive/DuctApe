Version 0.8.0
=============

UPGRADE URGENCY: LOW, if you work exclusively with DuctApe and use the standard bacterial PM plates

FEATURES:
* dphenome import-plates: the user can now analyze even custom plates
    * the table in test/input/newplate.tsv contains an example
* dphenome add/add-multi: PM data analyzed by different programs (i.e. opm) can now be imported
    * YAML/JSON file formats are supported
* dgenome export: PM data can now be exported in YAML/JSON format

BUGFIXES:
* dape init: if something goes wrong during DB creation raise an error
* Other small bugfixes

Version 0.7.0
=============

UPGRADE URGENCY: MODERATE; many features have changed, especially for the genomic analysis

FEATURES:
* Reactions copy number is no more analyzed: for pangenome and mutants experiments the program now focus on exclusive and distinct reaction IDs
    * dgenome stats/export, dape start/map have been changed accordingly
* dgenome annotate: new command to transfer kegg annotations inside an orthologous group
* dgenome deannotate: revert the annotation transfer
* Added a test directory with a simple script to test the three modules

BUGFIXES:
* PM data: prevent crashes in the clusterization step
* PM data: prevent crashes when parsing csv files
* kegg: final fix to handle correctly HTMLs from kegg 
* DB: speed improvements on big pangenomes
* Other small bugfixes

Version 0.6.2
=============

UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH; in some cases the KEGG html maps could not be retrieved correctly

kegg:
BUGFIX: the preparation of some kegg html maps resulted in failures

dgenome start:
FEATURE: roughly 3X speed improvements on BBH pangenome calculation, thanks to in-memory Blast searches


Version 0.6.1
=============

UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH; in some cases the KEGG data could not be retrieved correctly

kegg:
FEATURE: an improved connectivity check
BUGFIX: the insertion in the database of some kegg maps resulted in failures

dgenome start:
BUGFIX: in a corner case the pangenome calculation was performed twice

Version 0.6.0
=============

UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH; the control signal subtraction has been fixed on PM plate PM04A

dgenome start
FEATURE: roughly 3X speed improvements on BBH pangenome calculation 

dphenome zero
BUGFIX: the control signal subtraction has been fixed on PM plate PM04A

dphenome export
BUGFIX: the table with the average AV shouldn't contain the column "replica"

kegg:
FEATURE: fetch also the EC numbers for the Kegg reactions
BUGFIX: add some spaces when a tag retrieved with the "info" request spans multiple lines

dape start
BUGFIX: fixing again the compound duplication bug when creating metabolic networks

Version 0.5.4
=============

UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH; dphenome users may be unable to load some PM data 

dphenome
FEATURE: import/export plates data
BUGFIX: biolog parser shouldn't fail on unknown plates
BUGFIX: handle new possible plate names some plates names

dape
FEATURE: add-multi lets the user to provide multiple orgID
Fixed some typos

dape/dgenome/dphenome start:
FEATURE: added options to skip kegg map and phenomics parameters calculation

kegg:
FEATURE: internet connectivity is checked before the kegg mapping is performed

Version 0.5.3
=============

dape start
FEATURE: added AV color to KEGG compounds (GML graph output)
BUGFIX: avoid duplicated nodes in the metabolic graphs

Version 0.5.2
=============

dape start
BUGFIX: pangenome network analysis improvements

dphenome add
BUGFIX: handle csv files with a different OrgID than expected
BUGFIX: calculate the correct number of added plates

dphenome plot
FEATURE: added the ability to generate plots in svg formats (-s option)

Version 0.5.1
=============

BUGFIX: The net file was absent from the kegg module

Version 0.5.0
=============

First release
